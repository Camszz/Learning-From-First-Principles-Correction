This repo intends to give a correction to some of the exercises of Francis Bachâ€™s book : [Learning Theory from First Principles](https://www.di.ens.fr/%7Efbach/ltfp_book.pdf), which presents old and recent results in learning theory for the most widely used learning and proves many results starting from first principles.

Although most of the proposals in this pdf are used in the [official correction](https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/ltfp_exercises.pdf), alter-native formulations as well as solutions to exercises I have not done can be found on the official website. Please refer to the official correction for a proof-read by Pr Francis Bach version.
